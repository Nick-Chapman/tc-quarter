freshen skolen vars - for less unification / stricter checking

stratify elem space:
    x elem = xt|numeric(n)
    n numeric = number|address(a)
    a address = of-char|of-elem(x)

vars at muti levels: elem,numeric,address (as well as stack)

litx/litn/lita - so can preserve/recover types in gen code
